# Mini Minecraft
I built a miniature ground-up version of Minecraft with 2 other team members using only **C++** and **OpenGL**.

<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;">

</div>

**I was responsible for:**
+ **Player Physics** (movement + collision) with Grid-March Collision
+ **Texturing** (loading and matching block textures from a texture sheet) including Texture Animations (as seen on the surface of Water and Lava)
+ **Shadows** with Shadow Mapping
