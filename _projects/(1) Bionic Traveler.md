# Bionic Traveler

Designed and created UI elements for **UPGRADE** (Penn's Premiere Game Developement Club)’s 2021-2022 top-down 2D open-world game.

## Enemy Hackathon Winner!

UPGRADE hosted a very short hackathon during March 2022 for developers to form teams of 4 and churn out an enemy for the game within a short 6 hours. As part of a team with 3 others, I created visual assets and assisted the implementation of a teleporting enemy which was voted and awarded winner of the hackathon.

I believe there were two main reasons why our created monster exceeded:

1. As a long-time developer using Unity 3D to make 2D, 3D, and virtual reality games, I understood the pipeline through which assets needed to be created, formatted, and sent to the developers to a very deep level. This knowledge allowed me to create the neccessary art and visual assets that could be seemlessly integrated into the game engine without extra work needed from the programmer.

2. My years of experience in creating pixel art animations and understanding general animation principles allowed me to focus on delivering the best teleportation animations very quickly.

I was fortunate enough to have won a sponsored trip to the PAX East gaming expo in Boston through this competition where I met a graphics professor and networked with many indie game studios in Boston!

## Collaborated Across Art + Writing Teams

Developed branching storyline, diverse characters, and multi-node interactive dialogue with Yarn Spinner and collaborated cross-teams as both a writer and an artist. Click this card to download a demo of the Bionic Traveler game from Steam.

My role was essential to **bridging** the gap from writing team's storyboard...

...to an open world mini-map that put essential story locations in places that made sense in relation to each other.
